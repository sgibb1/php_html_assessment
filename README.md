# PHP In HTML Assessment

In this programming assignment you will be practicing embedding PHP inside of a webpage.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Part I

Make an index.php file with a standard HTML template.

Grab the bootstrap cdn from https://getbootstrap.com (Links to an external site.) and link it to your file like I showed in the video.

Make a separate PHP file and echo a bootstrap component (your choice!) from https://getbootstrap.com (Links to an external site.) inside of it

Include that PHP file inside your index.php page so that it renders to the page


Part II

Below your included component open up <?php ?> tags and do the following:
Make a variable for your name

Make 3 variables for the top 3 things you like about coding

Put these variables in appropriate HTML tags and echo them to the page
